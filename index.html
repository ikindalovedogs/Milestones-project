   <h1 class="orange">1965: Where it Began</h1>

   <p>The first touchscreen was invented by E.A. Johnson in 1965. Johnson worked at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern U.K. around the time that he invented the touchscreen.
     He published a full description of it for air traffic control in 1968.
     The type of touchscreen that Johnson invented is called a capacitive touchscreen.
     The use of this touchscreen ranges from old ATMs and GPS devices to the newest iPhone.
     The capacitive touchscreen works by having two thin grids of conductive metal layered on top of each other, when the screen is pressed, the layers apply themselves to each other and complete the circuit.
     The signal of where the finger or stylus touched the screen was deciphered much in the same way as finding a point on a coordinate grid.

   <h1 class="orange">Touchscreens in the 70s</h1>
   <p>Many things involving the development of touchscreens happened in the 1970s.
     Some things were independent discoveries, but some led to larger discoveries that occur later on in this timeline.
     Here are a few things that happened in the 70s involving this development:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>Dr. G. Samuel Hurst invents the first resistive touchscreen</li>
     <li>PLATO IV becomes the first touch based computer system to be used in a classroom.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>According to Baanto.com
     "A resistive touch screen is made of two transparent layers of glass or plastic...
     The conducting sides face one another and are separated by an air gap.
     When pressure is applied by the user, the top layer bends and touches the bottom layer."
     This is why older touchscreens felt almost kind of mushy, as the technology was not yet perfected.</p>

   <h1 class="orange">The 80s, a Big Decade for Touch Tech</h1>
   <p>The 80s was a big year for tech, and this includes the touchscreen, with other innovations such as graphic interfaces for computers.
     It is easy to see how touchscreen integrations have grown tremendously since this era. In the start of the decade, ’82 to be precise,
     the first human controlled multi-touch device was developed at The University.
     Multi-touch is a technology that allows for touchscreens to respond to input from multiple fingers at a time.
     For example; pinching to zoom out.
     Multi-touch technology is present to this day on almost every touchscreen product.
     In 1983, one of the first mainstream touchscreen computers, the HP-150, was released.
     Along with multi-touch, an interesting technology called Video Place was developed by Myron Krueger.
     Video Place can track hands and fingers, and figure out which people they belong to.</p>

   <h1 class="orange">A New Era of Technology: the 90s</h1>
   <p> The nineties, an era a tech pioneers an inspiration from pioneers past.
     In this decade many tech innovations happened, some of which will eventually merge with touchscreen technology, and some that already did.
     Here are the innovations of this decade…
     Most notably, the first ever phone to be made with a touchscreen was invented in 1993, this phone was called the Simon Personal Communicator,
     and was launched in cooperation by IBM and BellSouth Technologies.
     This, as you may know, was a huge breakthrough involving the relevant types of touchscreens today. Along with the Simon, the Apple Newton and the Palm handheld PDA were introduced, both in 1999.
     The Palm was operated by your fingers, while the Newton used a stylus.
     Apple later moved on to a stylus free mindset.
     Of course, touchscreens do include the use of styluses.
     Among these inventions, many more were made, and in the last few years of the second millennium, many new advancements were in store…

 <div id="world">
   <h1 class="orange">The 2000s, a new millennium, and lots of new tech</h1>
   <p> Lastly, the 2000s. This decade has by far the most innovation out of any of the decades listed. This decade brought with it many more flagship, and mainstream products with touchscreens. As the technology became closer to perfection. With the
     introduction of the original iPhone in 2007, one of the major leaps of the decade occurred. Many of us can’t go a day without our smartphones, and to an extent, it all began in 2007. The 2000s was a new type of “space race,” with companies
     aiming to perfect their touchscreens. For them to be bigger, thinner, faster, more durable, brighter and higher quality. This race is still going on. The first iPad was released in 2010, and Apple is aiming to continue this adventure. They are
     trying to make the iPad as practical as a computer, but all touch and no mouse! Along with the iPad, the surface was released in 2008, Apple’s main competitor.

     In conclusion, many innovations have been made as to how we interact with our tech, and it will continue changing as the years go by…
