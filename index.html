     /ˈtəCH ˌskrēn/

     <br> noun <br>
     A display screen that is sensitive to the touch of a finger or stylus</h3>

   <h1 class="orange">1965: Where it Began</h1>

   <p>The first touchscreen was invented by E.A. Johnson in 1965. Johnson worked at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern U.K. around the time that he invented the touchscreen.
     He published a full description of it for air traffic control in 1968.
     The type of touchscreen that Johnson invented is called a capacitive touchscreen.
     The use of this touchscreen ranges from old ATMs and GPS devices to the newest iPhone.
     The capacitive touchscreen works by having two thin grids of conductive metal layered on top of each other, when the screen is pressed, the layers apply themselves to each other and complete the circuit.
     The signal of where the finger or stylus touched the screen was deciphered much in the same way as finding a point on a coordinate grid.

   <h1 class="orange">Touchscreens in the 70s</h1>
   <p>Many things involving the development of touchscreens happened in the 1970s.
     Some things were independent discoveries, but some led to larger discoveries that occur later on in this timeline.
     Here are a few things that happened in the 70s involving this development:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>Dr. G. Samuel Hurst invents the first resistive touchscreen</li>
     <li>PLATO IV becomes the first touch based computer system to be used in a classroom.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>According to Baanto.com
     "A resistive touch screen is made of two transparent layers of glass or plastic...
     The conducting sides face one another and are separated by an air gap.
     When pressure is applied by the user, the top layer bends and touches the bottom layer."
     This is why older touchscreens felt almost kind of mushy, as the technology was not yet perfected.</p>
