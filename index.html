  <h1 class="orange">1965: Where it Began</h1>

  <p>The first touchscreen was invented by E.A. Johnson in 1965. Johnson worked at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern U.K. around the time that he invented the touchscreen.
    He published a full description of it for air traffic control in 1968.
    The type of touchscreen that Johnson invented is called a capacitive touchscreen.
    The use of this touchscreen ranges from old ATMs and GPS devices to the newest iPhone.
    The capacitive touchscreen works by having two thin grids of conductive metal layered on top of each other, when the screen is pressed, the layers apply themselves to each other and complete the circuit.
    The signal of where the finger or stylus touched the screen was deciphered much in the same way as finding a point on a coordinate grid.
    This is why older touchscreens felt almost kind of mushy, as the technology was not yet perfected. </p>
